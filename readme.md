Easily get events from the excellent [Midi Fighter Twister](https://store.djtechtools.com/products/midi-fighter-twister). Also allows you to drive the encoder LED rings and colors; as well as specify animations for those.

The addon also allows you to interface with the Midi Fighter Twister's built-in sequencer. The example shows how to do so.

This assumes the device is set with factory settings.

Requires [ofxMidi](https://github.com/danomatika/ofxMidi).
